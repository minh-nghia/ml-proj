Source code for BEng Final year project: Data Analytics for Anomaly Detection in sensitive data access.

The machine learning model is defined in ocsvm.py.
For more information please check https://github.com/minh-nghia/AE-1SVM

Coordinates of countries and zones are retrieved using Geopy in convert_coor.py.
The results are saved in zone_convert.json and country_convert.json (manually at the moment)

JSON database is extracted into Numpy array data.npy in extract_database.py.
Replace logs.json and alerts.json with proper file names.

The dimensions of the extracted Numpy array are:
0. Principle index
1. Operation index
2. Resource index
3. Request IP index
4-6. Request country coordinates
7-9. Resource zone coordinates
10-13. Resource zone one-hot encoding of sub-zone (a, b, c, d, .etc)
14. Daytime cosine.
15. Daytime sine.
16. Weektime cosine.
17. Weektime sine.
18. 1 if allowed log else -1.

tuning.py runs the model over a range of values for nu and gamma, with 5-fold cross validation

saving.py is the main training code.

UI.py implements the graphical interface using tkInter.
